# Spam SMS Detection using Machine Learning

A machine learning project that classifies SMS messages as **Spam** or **Ham (Not Spam)** using text classification techniques and multiple ML algorithms.

---

## Project Overview

This project focuses on detecting spam SMS messages through data preprocessing, feature extraction, and machine learning model training.  
By using **TF-IDF vectorization** and algorithms like **Naive Bayes**, **Logistic Regression**, **KNN**, and **Linear SVM**, the model can efficiently identify patterns common in spam messages such as URLs, special symbols, and message length. The project also compares which algorithm performs best.
