#Spam SMS Detection using Machine Learning

A machine learning project that classifies SMS messages as Spam or Ham (Not Spam) using text classification techniques and multiple ML algorithms.

#Project Overview

This project focuses on detecting spam SMS messages through data preprocessing, feature extraction, and machine learning model training.
By using TF-IDF vectorization and algorithms like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, KNN, and Linear SVM, the model can efficiently identify patterns common in spam messages such as URLs, special symbols, and message length. Also comparing which algorithm works the best.
